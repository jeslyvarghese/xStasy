#This is documentation for Xtasy Alpha which is a web  bases quiz contest framework.
#Xstasy aims at mimicking an MVC design though its not based on any MVC framweork and MVC principle of DRY isn't implemented strictly. You will see a lot of repatitions here..

#Xstasy files are listed as follows
/admin -> contains the code for admin panel, recursively follows the structure of root directory here
/code -> contains all code that implements business logic
/cult -> contains the configuration files
/frontend -> contains files for views
/images -> stores all images for the questions
/libraries -> contains all functions defined, also implements data logic
/scripts -> a part of view houses javascripts
/style -> view, style sheets

#All the code contains documentation though i plan to upload the basic working structure later

#My future plan is to re-write the code in any framework prefereably CodeIgnitor
